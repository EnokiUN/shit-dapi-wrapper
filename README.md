# Shit dAPI wrapper

A discord API wrapper so shit it makes your bot say shit uncontrollably.

usage: clone this repo and change the token and the ID on line 102 (probs)
(unless you like chaos) also make sure you have all the intents enabled on
the dev portal cuz uhhhhhh.

note: this is a joke, the api wrapper doesn't even have propper mappings let
alone features but it's fun to muck around with.
