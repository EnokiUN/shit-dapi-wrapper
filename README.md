# Shit dAPI wrapper

A Blazingly Fast (:rocket::rocket::rocket:) discord API wrapper so shit it
makes your bot say shit uncontrollably.

usage: clone this repo and change the token and the ID on line 102 (probs)
(unless you like chaos) also make sure you have all the intents enabled on
the dev portal cuz uhhhhhh.

"it's not fast it's shit" 
Believe me friend, its fuckingly fast, you don't even have to take my word for
it just [tias](https://tryitands.ee).

note: this is a joke, the api wrapper doesn't even have propper mappings let
alone features but it's fun to muck around with.
